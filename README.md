Build
-----

The following sequence of commands will build the net.betaengine codebase on Linux or Mac OS X and should be easy to adapt for Windows.

    $ java -jar lib/jarjar-1.4.jar process assembly/resources/rules.txt ti-resources/smartConfig.jar lib/com.ti.smartconfig-1.1.jar
    $ mkdir -p bin
    $ javac -d bin -classpath 'lib/*' $(find src -name '*.java')

The first step repackages the original TI smartConfig.jar file into a useable jar called com.ti.smartconfig-1.1.jar.

Tools
-----

Once you've built the codebase you can run the various tools as follows.

### mDNS listener

    $ java -classpath 'bin:lib/*' net.betaengine.mdns.MDNSListener

### Smart Config responder

    $ java -classpath 'bin:lib/*' net.betaengine.smartconfig.device.Responder <device-name>

If no device-name is provided then the default name "CC3000" is used.

### Smart Config desktop UI

    $ java -classpath 'bin:resources:lib/*' net.betaengine.smartconfig.desktop.Main

Decoder
-------

Running the decoder is a little more complex than the other tools.

It should be run in combination with tshark like so:

    $ tshark -o 'wlan.enable_decryption:FALSE' \
        -i en0 -I -f 'subtype qos-data' -Y 'wlan.fc.retry==0' -T fields \
        -e wlan.bssid -e radiotap.channel.freq -e wlan.sa -e wlan.da -e data.len 2> /dev/null \
        | java -classpath "bin:lib/*" net.betaengine.smartconfig.device.decoder.Consumer

Replace `en0` with the appropriate wifi device reported by:

    $ tshark -D

Note: stderr is redirected to `/dev/null` simply in order to throw away the frame count information that tshark reports.
It looks like one should be able to disable this output with `-Q` but this does not work with my version of tshark.
